# Hello, I'm Rachel

I'm a third year Computer Science major at NYU. You'll find short writings on my open source experience here, updated weekly. 

When I'm not in school, I enjoy sketching, boxing, and taking care of my plants. You can find most of my shenanigans on [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rachelyhe/).

### What I Do

For the past two years, I've been pursuing a career in Product Design (digital products like apps, not fancy chairs or toys). If you're bored, check out [my portfolio site](https://www.rachelyhe.com/) or read [this thing I wrote](https://uxdesign.cc/coursera-a-mobile-redesign-case-study-28486273d80b).

### Things I Like

• reading Don Norman's [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/1452654123)
