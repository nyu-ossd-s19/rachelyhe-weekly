## Caprine Progress
This week we submitted a PR that was reviewed and ultimately needs a small tweak. I added a commit that fixed this small change, and it's currently being reviewed. We learned that the core maintainers are very active with PRs, reviews, and issues. This will definitely help moving forward with bigger issues.

Moving forward, our to-do list includes:
* proposing a third party chat / forum for the repository 
* tackling a couple larger issues after our PR is successfully merged

## Kevin Fleming
I was out sick for Kevin's talk during class, but I'll update this page with my thoughts as soon as I'm able to review his presentation slides.
