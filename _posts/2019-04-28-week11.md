## Caprine : Contributions
Over the course of the last four weeks, [@sadmanf](https://github.com/sadmanf), [@ericachio](https://github.com/ericachio), and I worked together to contribute to [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/)'s project [Caprine](https://github.com/sindresorhus/caprine).

As the person who pitched this project to the class, I'm glad I got to work on it myself during the course of this semester. I'm also pretty happy with our work on this project. We started of by commenting on and submitting issue reports and ended up submitting PRs for bug fixes and features. 

Personally, I submitted our first issue report, which detailed a small reponsive UI problem. It was verified and a commit was ultimately reviewed and merged over the course of three weeks. The contribution I'm most proud of is being tracked [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/caprine/pull/865). Some other things I directly contributed to include:
* fulfilling a change requested on our very first pull request, seen [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/caprine/pull/861#partial-pull-merging)
* creating our [team](https://github.com/orgs/nyu-ossd-s19/teams/capri-sun/repositories) on GitHub
* bug gardening on [this issue report](https://github.com/sindresorhus/caprine/issues/853)
* submitting [this issue report](https://github.com/sindresorhus/caprine/issues/869), which ended up being closed because it had already been resolved (oops!)
* formatting and maintaining our team wiki

For open-sourcers who are not a member of our Open Source class team, you can review our public team wiki [here](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/caprine/wiki). It details the full extent of our contributions as a group.
