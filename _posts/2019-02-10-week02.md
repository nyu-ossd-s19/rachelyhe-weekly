## Browser Extension : tickStop
Our extension is a timer that keeps track of how much a user actively spends time on different social media platforms and alerts them when they exceeds the a user-specified time limit.

So far I've added a second layer to the architecture of the extension that reminds the user that they've exceeded their time permissions every 5 minutes after their initial time is up. 


## Extension Status
At its current current stage, the extension functions at a simple proof-of-concept. When the user logs into Facebook, a timer is set off for 20 minutes. Once the alarm fires after those 20 minutes, a periodic timer is triggered that reminds the user every 5 minutes that they've exceeded their time limit.


## What I Learned
I've learned that a key part of working in GitHub is *branching and merging*. Branching is helpful in safely testing out new features without permanently writing over the original. Merging helps bring changes in two different branches together into one.
